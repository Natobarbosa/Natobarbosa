### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have recently graduated as a Full Stack Web Developer at Le Wagon, and I am a current student of the 1-year Digital Marketing Specialist Co-op course at the Toronto School of Management (since Sep, 21). For our demo day project at Le Wagon, we have built a social app for meeting people from your home country when you are living abroad. Basically, an app where you can meet and message people from the same country of origin and also create and participate in events with these people (https://github.com/Natobarbosa/home_away). 

In this project, I have made most of the front-end programing, since that is the area that I want to specialize. I already have some good understanding and experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript (including AJAX and DOM manipulation).

I am now currently preparing myself to be a full stack Quality Assurance engineer. I am, therefore, studying test automation with Selenium and all other tools for the job: Testing management tools, Agile methodology, Jira bug tracking tool and manual testing techniques.

I have also over 5 years of experience with Digital Marketing, in a B2B hi-tech Virtual Reallity Startup. There, I had the opportunity to help with the implementation of a successful marketing strategy for the acquisition of corporate clients for the development of proof-of-concept projects. In the last year, I have also built an ecommerce store, which has given me a lot of knowledge with Shopify and e-commerce oriented digital marketing (mainly with social media and ppc search engine marketing).
