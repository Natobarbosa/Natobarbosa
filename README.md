### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have recently graduated as a Full Stack Web Developer at Le Wagon, and I am a current student of the 1-year Digital Marketing Specialist Co-op course at the Toronto School of Management (since Sep, 21). Although I have graduated as a Full Stack Web Developer, I am currently searching for a Front-end position. 

I have also over 5 years of experience with Digital Marketing, in a B2B hi-tech Virtual Reallity Startup. There, I had the opportunity to help with the implementation of a successful marketing strategy for the acquisition of corporate clients for the development of proof-of-concept projects. In the last year, I have also built an ecommerce store, which has given me a lot of knowledge with Shopify and e-commerce oriented digital marketing (mainly with social media and ppc search engine marketing).
